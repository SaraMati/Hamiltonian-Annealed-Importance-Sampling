Code to perform Hamiltonian Annealed Importance Sampling for partition function estimation, log likelihood estimation, and importance weight estimation in models with intractable partition functions.  Can also be used for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling (single step, with partial momentum refreshment).

See HAIS_examples.m for example usage.
